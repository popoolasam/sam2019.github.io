<br> <b>"Achievement  is something which somebody has succeeded in doing especially offer a lot of effort, great courage, skill etc."</b>. 
No one has ever achieve greatness without dream. Every achievement in life is a slave. </br>
<br> It is also the act of performing  something  profession, dreams and  accomplishment.
And in life no one has ever achieve  greatness without a dream </br>
<br> positive life. An achievement can occur with much or little efforts and it is a thing that may or may not be quantifiable. </br>
<br> My achievement started or occur when I was in secondary school, 
though I was an average student in my class then I thought I was the best out of my class  then when I entered jss3. 
I knew I was not as good as the rest of the student, as at that time we we're about to write our junior west African  examination, 
then I saw student that are more better than me academically. That motivate me the more then.
I was determined to-do well In the following term that was my senior secondary school. 
I lessen the friends I walk with people back bite behind me I don't care because I was determined with what am doing. 
Then later on I saw goodness in what am doing in the sense that I gained more academically, socially, physically, 
and I was pleased with myself.The life of a determined soul is achieved with focus and faith.
